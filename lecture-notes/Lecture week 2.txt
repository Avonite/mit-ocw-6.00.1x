Strings are immutable: you can't change certain parts of a string but you can change the string in total

For loops can be used to iterate a string per character
	for char in s

Bisection search:
	computationally faster than previous guess and check. 
	for every guess we discard half of the other possibilities, so the range in which the answer lies becomes smaller and smaller
	powerful idea used in computer science

Two important ideas:
	decomposition: use several projectors to compose one image; break problem in different self contained pieces
	abstraction: do not need to know the specifics to know how it works, we can use something but do not need to know the details; surpress details of method to compute something from that computation

Reusable code is created with: functions
	1. function name
	2. parameters (can have 0 parameters)
	3. docstring: description of what the function does (optional)
	4. body: the actual code

	Use def to define the function. Use return to define the value what comes out of the function
	
	Calling functions: formal parameter gets bound to an actual value which is run through the code when function is called.

Iteration: uses some test and runs a block of code which changes the tested variable, code runs as long as the test is true
Recursion: breaks the problem into a simples problem, and does this untill the problem is solved. Done by using a function inside a function. A new scope is created for every new value, so there is no confusion.

Mathematical induction: proof something is true for smallest number, and proof it is true for a random number. If both are true assume it is true for all values greater than the smallest number.
